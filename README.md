Practice GitHub for DH1

Hello Dr. Thomas and classmates!

I am learning how to use GitHub as well as its purpose for the Week 7 class assignment. 
It seems quite simple as long as you follow the clear instructions given by the tutorial.
Finishing up how to make edits to a particular file without disrupting others. 

See you all tonight!
